The Healthy Brain Network (HBN) dataset is a clinical sample of about five-thousand 5-22 year-olds who have undergone both clinical and research screenings. The objective of the HBN study is to find biological markers that will improve the diagnosis and treatment of mental health and learning disorders from an objective biological perspective. Two elements of this study are being used for this competition: physical activity data (wrist-worn accelerometer data, fitness assessments and questionnaires) and internet usage behavior data. The goal of this competition is to predict from this data a participant's Severity Impairment Index (sii), a standard measure of problematic internet use.
